# Fail Fast

## Situation 
Fail Fast… Safely: 
<p>Teams want to quickly test emerging tools to solve their immediate communication and business challenges. What guidance would you give them to ensure they are being safe and productive as they experiment?</p>

## Solution

- Document the process and take notes for comparing all researched and tested solutions.
- Make sure the needs are clearly outlined and that there isn't already existing or under-utilized software in the stack that might be able to meet those needs.
- Maintain a preference for open-sourced projects with code easily auditable versus closed source wherever possible.
- Review privacy and security policies to ensure there are no glaring issues with security or data storage, handling, and usage. 
- Perform a quick search of the product and founders to gain a clearer picture of the project’s history. Check to see if past security incidents or breaches have occurred and how they were handled. The company's age and the founders past company histories will also provide some valuable insight into the future trajectory of the company and software. 
- Ensure there are adequate security features (and that they are used when testing) to protect accounts and data including encrypted storage of data, two factor authentication with security keys or one-time codes (no SMS), and complex passwords.
- Ensure there is adequate documentation and support resources, or possibly even training options in place. 
- Actually test their support team to assess their response times and knowledge of the product. Also ensure that they have 24/7 support hours if needed to align with our distributed teams needs. 
- Confirm how feature requests and bugs will be handled, as well as how often updates typically take place. 
- Look for export options, preferably compatible with comparable solutions to ensure data is not held hostage on the platform. 
- Look for features such as SCIM, SAML/SSO, and APIs to allow for scalability and flexibility of future needs.  
- Assess and consider the integration and interoperability features within the existing software stack.
- Connect with a dedicated product representative when possible to gain access to elevated service levels, as well potentially negotiate subscriptions and billing. Definitely cross reference their answers to the above questions with your own research findings.
- Ensure that accounts for unused platforms are fully closed and deleted, and that no billing subscriptions are left active.
- Open invitation to contact me at any time for an additional opinion or recommendations.
- At the end of the project, I would connect with the project lead to see if they have any other suggestions they feel should be added to this list. Then combine and publish the information in the knowledgebase so that it can easily be referred to and adapted for future project needs.
